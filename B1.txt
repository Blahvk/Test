Indicators of compromise(IOCs) serve as forensic evidednce of potential intrusions on a host system or network.
From the list of extracted IOCs, these are the few indicators that will be able to provide some clues/leads to aid in a cyber threat investigation. The indicators are namely domain name, creation data, expiration date, registrar, name servers, status, WHOIS server, updated date, admin/technical contact and DNSSEC.
Domain name is able to provide insights into that particular entity and gives an indicator as to whether there is a broader compromise involved.
Creation date can help to determine the timeline of the threat, provide clues about its origin and helps to complete an analysis and evaluation of the source.
Expiration date can be used to indicate the longevity or short term nature of the infrastructure.
Registrar can help indentifying the entity responsible for registering and managing the domain.
Name Servers can provide clues or reveal the infrstructure used to host the threat.
Status can indicate if the domain is active/suspended or flagged for abuse which can provided insights of the malicious activities.
WHOIS server provides information about the domain registration and ownership.
Updated date tells us the when was the recent changes made to the domain.
Admin/Technical Contact provides a next level of investigation to start from.
DNSSEC indicates whether the domain has implemented additional security measures which can help to understand the level of security and potential vulnerabilities.
