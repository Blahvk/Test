1)Analyze the existing IOCs - review the IOCs mentioned in the report, understand the context and significance of each IOC

2)Cross-reference - compare existing IOCs with known threat intelligence feeds or databases to identify if any of the IOCs are already recognised. This will help to filter out some IOCs.

3)Perform IOC enrichment - use threat intelligence sources to do so.

4)Identify anomalies - Use detection techniques and behavioural analysis to identify any unusual or suspicious patterns in IOCs.

5)Collaborate with industry experts - Share with the cyber community about the recent findings. Collaboration might help identify emerging threatsnew patterns that might not be widely known.
